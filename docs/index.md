# I'm Muhammad — Your AI Expert

I'm an independent consultant, advisor, and Google Developer Expert with over a decade of hands-on experience in building and scaling machine learning systems. I help businesses turn complex AI challenges into clear, actionable strategies that deliver real-world impact.

Whether you're navigating the ever-evolving landscape of Generative AI or trying to unlock the full potential of LLMs, I can guide you from ideation to execution—with a focus on measurable results.

Before diving into consulting, I earned a Ph.D. in Applied Machine Learning, specializing in wearable sensors and biomedical signal processing. You can browse my academic research and publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vQcpPPAAAAAJ\&hl=en).

I’m also deeply committed to open-source and community-driven learning. I created **[localGPT](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/localGPT)**, one of the first open-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) projects for secure, private document interaction—now with over **20k GitHub ⭐**.

On my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@engineerprompt) with **193k+ subscribers**, I regularly share practical insights on LLMs, Generative AI, Agents, and more. Join the conversation on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nMEEN2sS), where 4,500+ members exchange ideas, ask questions, and build cool stuff together.
