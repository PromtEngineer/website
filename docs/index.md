# üëã I am Muhammad!

I'm an independent consultant, advisor, and Google Developer Expert with over 10 years of experience building impactful machine learning systems. I help my clients achieve their business and personal goals by guiding them through the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

In a previous life, I earned my Ph.D. in Applied Machine Learning, where I specialized in building wearable sensors and applying machine learning to biomedical signal processing. You can explore my research and publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vQcpPPAAAAAJ&hl=en).

I'm also passionate about open source and community building. I'm also the creator of [**localGPT**](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/localGPT), one of the earliest open-source implementations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for secure, private document interaction, with over **20k GitHub ‚≠ê**.

I regularly share my thoughts and practical tips and insights about LLMs, Generative AI, Agents, and more on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@engineerprompt) with **193k+ subscribers**. I also have an engaging community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nMEEN2sS) of **4,500+ members**.
