# RAG Beyond Basics Course

## Build Powerful Chat-With-Documents Applications Using Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Techniques and the Latest LLMs.

‚≠ê Master the "How" AND the "Why" of RAG in a Hands-on, Practical Setting ‚≠ê

## üëÄ What's This Course All About?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is shaking up the tech scene, allowing individuals and companies alike to build robust applications that can seamlessly interact with text-based documents. Imagine chatting directly with PDFs and extracting precise insights in seconds‚Äîproductivity has never been this accessible! üìàüìö

This course combines in-depth theory with hands-on coding sessions, empowering you to craft sophisticated RAG applications from scratch. You'll learn both proprietary APIs (like OpenAI) and how to build fully local solutions for maximum privacy and flexibility.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Who Should Take This Course?

- ‚úÖ **SaaS Founders**: Turn your MVP into a powerful product that users love (and investors notice!).
- ‚úÖ **Developers**: Quickly transform your innovative ideas into working prototypes.
- ‚úÖ **Executives**: Analyze thousands of documents in minutes‚Äînot days‚Äîand become a game-changing leader.
- ‚úÖ **Hobbyists**: Explore cutting-edge AI and master advanced techniques at your own pace.

All you need is basic Python knowledge and a curiosity to learn. Familiarity with tools like LangChain or Streamlit is a bonus, but definitely not required!

## üõ† What Will We Cover?

We'll start from a foundational understanding and build up to advanced methods, crafting a complete, high-performance RAG pipeline along the way.

Here's a structured breakdown:

### Lesson 1: Getting Started with RAG
- Introduction: What is RAG?
- Setup your virtual environment & API keys.
- Building blocks of basic RAG applications.

### Lesson 2: Building Your First RAG Pipeline (Code Time!)
- Hands-on coding your initial RAG pipeline.
- Chatting seamlessly with PDF documents.

### Lesson 3: Advanced Query Techniques & Re-ranking
- Supercharge retrieval accuracy with **Query Expansion**.
- Refine results precisely using re-ranking techniques (**GPT-4, ColBERT, Cohere**).

### Lesson 4: Hypothetical Document Embeddings & Retrieval Ensembles
- Generate targeted "Hypothetical Documents" to enrich your retrieval.
- Leverage ensemble retrieval methods (combining semantic & keyword-based searches).

### Lesson 5: Hierarchical Chunking & Parent Document Retrieval
- Implement **Hierarchical Chunking** to extract richer contexts.
- Explore advanced parent-document retrieval methods for accurate answers.

### Lesson 6: Creating Interactive GUI Applications
- Build a beautiful, intuitive frontend with Streamlit.
- Deploy a fully working GUI RAG application you can proudly showcase.


## üìö How's It All Structured?

Each lesson kicks off with a clear explanation of "why" we use specific methods, followed by detailed, hands-on coding examples illustrating the "how". By the end, you'll have a robust, scalable, and fully customized RAG pipeline that solves real-world document interaction problems.
